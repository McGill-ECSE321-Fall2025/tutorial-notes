=== Use Case Diagram

We also want to describe the use cases for the event registration application using a use case diagram.

The diagram above shows the following.

- Any user can search for and view events.
- To register for an event, a user must have an account.
- Premium users have all the same privileges as a regular account holder. In addition, they can create events.
- Only guests can sign up and log in (users who are already logged in don't need these features).
