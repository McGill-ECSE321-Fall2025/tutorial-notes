=== Setting up a Spring Boot Project

We will use the Spring Boot framework to implement the backend of the event registration system.
In this section, we will use Spring Initializr to quickly generate the folder structure and some files for a new Spring Boot project.

. Go to https://start.spring.io/.
. Set the project type to Gradle.
. Leave the Spring Boot version at the default value.
. Set the names for the group, package, etc.
. Set the Java version.
. Add the following dependencies:
    .. web
    .. data-jpa
    .. postgresql

NOTE: Since Java version 25 is released on September 16, 2025, you have the option to choose Java 25 for Spring Initializr. However, as of September 24, 2025 (the date where this tutorial was delivered), this is a false claim on their side since Gradle 8.14.3, which is used by Spring Initializr, does not support Java 25. Therefore, if you choose Java 25, you will run into build errors later on. Simply fallback to Java 24 or an earlier version will fix the issue. Eventually Spring Initializr will likely update to Gradle 9.1.0+, which supports Java 25.

Click "GENERATE" and you should get a zip file.
Unzip it, move the files into your Git repository, and rename the directory to EventRegistration-Backend.
Later, we will add a new directory EventRegistration-Frontend for the user interface code.
Your Git repository should look something like this:

```

Open `EventRegistration-Backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` and write the following configuration information:
```
spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.postgresql.Driver

# What to do with existing database tables on startup and shutdown.
# See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/data-initialization.html#howto.data-initialization.using-hibernate.
# ddl-auto=create-drop means all database tables are created on startup and
# dropped (deleted) on shutdown.
# ddl-auto=update does not drop tables on shutdown. It will add new tables and
# columns on startup, but will not delete existing ones.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

# Adding the following line leads to better error messages in case the URL or
# credentials are wrong
spring.jpa.database-platform = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Be careful with the URL format: it is easy to make a typo here
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/event_registration
spring.datasource.username = postgres
spring.datasource.password = PASSWORD

# Decide which port our backend will listen on.
# This is relevant for deliverable 2.
# Could also just set server.port = 8080 to always listen on port 8080.
# The advantage of using the following form is that you can change the port on
# startup, e.g., using .\gradlew bootRun --args='--port=9090'.
server.port = ${port:8080}
```

(`PASSWORD` is the password you chose while setting up the local database.)

WARNING: For simplicity, we store our local database password directly in the public configuration file. *Don't do this with real credentials. Look for resources on proper secrets management (e.g., https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).*
